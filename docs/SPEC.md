# my-app-spec

## Description
A specification-first repository documenting the planned architecture and structure of a modern web application.

## Purpose
This repository serves as the source of truth for the application design and serves as the blueprint before implementation begins. It contains all planning documentation and architectural decisions.

- Implement modular architecture following NestJS best practices
- Set up database models and migrations
- Implement RESTful API endpoints
- Add authentication and authorization
- Implement unit and integration tests

### Planned Technology Stack
